Welcome to my Custom .tbl files!                                                                              
Some files are to big to upload to Github in .tbl form, so I added them as .csv                                       
Use Nexusvault to convert from .csv to .tbl                                                                      
Convert " "                                                                                                          
You put your file locaton inside the " ", so for me it looks like : Convert "F:\my custom tbls\custom\tbl\Creature2.csv"
This set of .tbl/.csv files are made for fixing quests that are missing entitys in Murkmire, Dreadmoor, And Halon Ring (they are in the client, but we could not traval to them on the live game)
Coralus quest fixs will be added someday (we have the map in a prealpha client, when we add it to the newest client, I will start working on)
As of 5/18/24 this is a test file set, this was to test adding missing quest objects for quest 8192 and 8199.
I still need to find out the Uiflags for them, and LocalTextIdName was not added into the game, so the WS commuinity will name it. Creature2DisplayGroup will also be picked by the WS commuinity.
